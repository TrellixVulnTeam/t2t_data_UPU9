I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
I went to this urgent care center and was blown away with their service .
They came on time and completed their work quickly .
But just this week a peddle broke .
Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that did n't exist .
While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel we are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels
Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
Save money and go somewhere else !
After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
Who does that ?!
Totally flavored
Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin' : sad face :
GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead .
Thanks Josh !

Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
Highly Recommended
Filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
Poor service
Great instructors !
It turned out being very good quality tmobile service and I was happy with the new tmobile phone .
Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone 's warehouse .
And then wait again .
many thanks 2scompany ...
I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
Will definitely go back when I need medical care .
This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .

For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice . 	
( it 's by the door , on the hostess stand )
I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
But not at a risk to other people 's pets .
Salad bar is hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges .
After they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked , it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done .
what a mind blowing servicing
It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients .
And the exterminator is very nice , also .
They fixed the queso !
I am a college student .
The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A&E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A&E does not ) .

First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I do n't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) .
Yes , Manson .
I brought it back with 9000 miles .
My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
They are by far the best salon in 50 miles , Trust me I know !!
If I found a spot , I could nt fit in it .
We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
They have a customer for life in us !
Compact 's Corona dryers remove at least twice as much water as the previous dryers , allowing a production increase of over 10 % and a significant energy saving .
Holy cow was that a delicious meal .
I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I 've had with bigger offices and firms .
That 's my favorite show of all time .
Got some nice 	 freshly baked 	 fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine .
Best Stationery store in Bethesda

Great product , great service !!!
Best YET !
Great Service and hairstyles that last .
Okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year .

The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
Many thanks from myself and all of our wedding guests !
Good Pizza at a good price

Prices are reasonable , ( Kid s meals are around 4.99 ) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
And he says : You 're at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
Stephanie 's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .

We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
The lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about $ 6 .
You 've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
Good sports bar .
However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
Equipment is state of the art .
She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our car s problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ) .
I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
Great place to catch a band or catch up with friends .
I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
long lines on the weekends but worth it
I figure I would give this company a chance .
Great work !
What a history .
Oh , and salad cream , not mayonnaise , on the coleslaw .
Good Food .
Yes , they accepted it .
This shop is by far the best I have been to .
The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !
Chuck and Gretchen were very positive , and when Alan 's refused to work on my bike , Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan 's mechanic would n't do .
DO NOT EVER GO HERE .
I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend 's aunt recommended it .
The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
I really want to like this place since I work right around the corner .
Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted .
I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
The pizzas are huge and super delicious .
They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
It was all sorted with no hassle at all and I 'm really grateful - they were fab .
Great service and awesome prices .
I recommend them highly !
Although I 'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I 'll gladly do it knowing that since she 's been astounding to me once before that she 'll always be that way !
Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
You should give her a try - it 's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
With these fusions , chiropractric is n't as successful , but it still is very helpful .
We love our new roof !
Terrible communication as well .
You ca n't go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
Fantastic , quick and efficient service .
Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
Awesome Landscaping Job
It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
junkie lube ?!
The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
Great computer repair store , highly recommended .
The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I 'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
Beer a bit expensive .
Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
I will go there again .
Very nice work and friendly guys too .
After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
Do not use this company !
Calls are now forwarded to Malcolm Smith Motorsports down the road .
I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10 am to make the repair .
The best customer service I 've come across for long time .
The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
I also mentioned to the reception person .
We were greeted again and sat promptly .
This French born , French trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh , locally sourced , fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations .
I was ready to buy a new jacket , a new sweater and a couple of your overpriced belts and I walked out because of your obvious lurking
In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
I brought a car in to have the 	 check engine 	 light diagnosed back in March of 2010 .
Try their weekend 	 tastings 	 which you can learn about by getting on their weekly email list .
If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
Britt 's Pizza is long gone .
What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring .
I mean , I do n't care if he does n't know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there 's no way I 'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
I would hesitate to recommend anyone .
this is a good place
No tub .
We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
Overall - good stuff .
i was very pleased with the service .
I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
Aside from that little * mystery * , one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
They are sooooo beautiful .
That 's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
It 's fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ?
A perfect place for a romantic dinner .
I worked with Sam Mones who took great care of me .
Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
Good food and coffee with a nice atmosphere
So professional !
When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had 	 reserved 	
Their location , the northwest corner of S. 10th & Federal Sts. , is now home to Slice Pizza .
I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I 've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
Best meat pies in Canada
Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
happy customer
Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it 's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car would n't pass unless I replaced a hose .
HORRIBLE !!!! !
Walked in and was out ta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying a lot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr - 22 they were able to get me the best deal out there .
I do nt go there anymore
To make a order you may have to go to back of line .
The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
That is just unheard of these days !
Noticed a few of these Cookie cutter places opening in Summit and New Providence .
I will be using Bridies again .
really amazing the new and exciting plays done at this theatre !
I was hoping to have found a regular place to eat .
He worked on it right on the back of my car .
FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
Feels like you are in Brooklyn , but people watching is entertaining .
I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
Highly Recommend
They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
We have never had a bad experience buying from Edmark .
This was a less than impressive experience at Trio 's .
I love walking in and not being hassled .
1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
The World 's Fair museum was pretty cool .
They have always done a great job at a reasonable price .
What a Dump !
Rude Rude Rude
REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
best
I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
Can not ask for a better experience .
I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
Absolutely a wonderful company .
Good quality Indian food in a pleasant environment
This is a great facility .
Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
Had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant .
Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
A&E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
great ! :P
I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
Craig and Nate are wonderful .
home team - thanks 4 playin !!!
I had to dig in a bag to find one nice feather , what a joke !
Farrell Electric is a very good electrical contractor .
Great job on my roof and the pricing was fair .
They also got my friend s order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
Yum .
I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
Really enjoyed it .
The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
I was appalled .
I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
Love this place !!
My friend and I went there for lunch today .
but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose 's prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ) .
Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed it s electrical !
The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
Super nice people , really good food
These people were so helpful this week and did everything to sort out my windscreen and insurance .
It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
Well done to Anthony and the team !
I have nothing but fantastic things to say .
The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
wonderful
Top range of bike , cheap prices , excellent a +++
Rocky M. Lange Retired Coordinator , Clark County School District
Excellent !
Kitchen puts out good food and has daily specials .
Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
First and Last time we 'll eat there
And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
this kebab shop is one of the best around the meat is good and fresh and the chilly sauce is the best , keep them lovely kebabs coming and a happy new year to all the staff
You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
I will definitely refer my friends and family :)
Amazing customer service
The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
That 's 3 x worse than Qwest DSL 's lowest speed offering !
We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
Food drastically let's the place down though
They are especially rude to women .
Antiques , Vintage , Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers .
This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
impressive truly impressive
I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was n't possible .
Line up is so stupid .
The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
Cute place also
Beautiful hotel !
My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
This place is bad .
Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
My results were just AWFUL .
They were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery .
Now I 've found someone who can manage to do what I really want .
I have nothing bad to say .
No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
No more having to drive to San Francisco for a great mani pedi .
I still have surgically induced hair loss .
The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
A thoroughly comprehensive service ; excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee ( ie nothing is simply implied or assumed ) .
Last time I went however , my beer was warm and the service was so - so .
We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
A lot .
I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ) .
In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
I normally do n't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one wo n't be getting my business , nor my family 's , nor my co-workers .
The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that 's not why I 'm writing my review .
Queso should not be watery :( .....
Thanks Southland .
Do not use these guys .
I walked away .
We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
They were beautiful and lasted forever !
These guys took Customer Service 101 from a Neanderthal .
Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
I was n't going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
All I can say is that Elmira you are the best I ve experienced , never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you .
According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
excellent !
I hope I can return the favor in the future !
I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
Well done to Brendan and the team !
good outside , bad inside
Mixed Tempura ..................... 8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad .
The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
The food was out standing .
Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9 pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee ! ) .
Save yourself a trip !
He will exceed your expectations !
I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
Pleasure to work with .
Sanctuary serves delicious , somewhat healthy food in a great restaurant / fast food style .
This place has the best baby and children s clothes .
I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
Worst Apartments EVER
That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
I could not understand any his reasons .
Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
the waitress took my name and then called me that all night .
It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ... )
I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
The smokehouse ca n't be beat anywhere .
Even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at Sprecher 's .
great tmobile service
They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
Incompetent servers , kitchen and management .
I rang SRD PAT testing and within 3 hours Scot had come to my premises and PAT tested all my our Spill The Whisky barn dance band equipment , and supplied a certificate for only 70 p per unit .
I 've referred everyone i know here and they all feel the same way !!
Beautiful work , fast shipping and great communication .
So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You wo n't regret it !!
Good Job DR .
AMAZINGLY YUMMY !
Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
We have never had a problem with the cabins .
Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ) .
He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
The fitness center was GREAT !
I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
Yeah , this complex is not very good .
And from a place that specializes in high quality meat , too .
Well kept facility with friendly staff .
Worst place flour tortillas are always hard the beef enchiladas are discussing meat all over cooked was good many yrs ago but restaurant has gone down hill
I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
I 'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
I hired this company to unlock my car .
Bad food and bad service !
Would do business with them again .
SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
What a fantastic store , I love this place .
Bottom line is that when it 's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
I am not a client of liquidweb.com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
He immediately said 	 no , there is a $ 50 deposit now ! 	
Sanctuary is amazing !
There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity .
He had a robe that was made back in the '60s .
We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
If you mention the name Amir you will receive % 10 off at time of purchase
The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
recommended
I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
I never wait in the waiting room more than two minutes and the cleanings are quick and painless .
Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
Best Cigar lounge on the blouvard .
Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
David Bundren is the Tire GooRoo .
Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3 M , no exceptions .
Jana made me feel very comfortable .
The Salon Experience from Hell

I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
I do n't get it .
Stayed in the Seaview room here in December 2009 !
I think that the re pretty good .
Salon is clean and girls are nice .
The food is superb and they were delivered nice and hot !

Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville .
We 'll be back often .
The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
Highly recommended !!
Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
Trust me , you go there once and you -ll always go back !
Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
And they THRIVE to get a customer .
The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly .
Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
Very kind and reliable .
It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
This is a great place to get a permit
I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and 	 There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck 	 .
BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's .
I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
AWESOME food !
It was n't completly impossible !!!!
Harlan provides great service .
( I 've been through at least 5 places already . )
We honestly can not think of even 1 thing we did n't like !
Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
The employees are really friendly .
Might try again
The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
Best in HR so far !
Cecile is a hairdresser and has just moved into the neighbourhood .
Teachers good Diverse student body ( African - American , Asian , ect. ) equals kids staying here !
Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
Nice teachers good school
In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ) .
Thanks Cheveux !
Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
You can fool people
Have a real mechanic check before you buy !!!!
Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time . -
friendly , fine food
Horrible !
Favorite DD spot in the area !
Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that does n't impress me .
Very knowledgeable and friendly design build firm .
I called over the weekend due to clogged kitchen sink .
Great place 5 stars for sure .
Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700 .
I definitely recommend him :)
Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno 's .
I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
I always leave loving my hair style .
The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
Just do n't go there .
Internet Department is rude and insulting
Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
Well done .
They do n't take coupons .
Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just ca nt find in a lot of stores .
Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
