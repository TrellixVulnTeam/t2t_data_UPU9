A thoroughly comprehensive service ; excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee ( ie nothing is simply implied or assumed ) .
they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
They bake bread fresh daily , they do n't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .

Great food and nice people very pleasant experience .

He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
This place has the best baby and children s clothes .
Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
many thanks

I highly recommend Debi , she does an amazing job , I 	 love 	 the way she cuts my hair , extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect .

The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone 's business !
Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
For the quality , the prices ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend 's aunt recommended it .

An Hour Of Prego Bliss !
In a few words ... I 'm pleasantly surprised that you can still find 	 old school 	 service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets ...
Ca n't you make a decent cup of coffee ?
I used to take my cars there all the time , but management changes hands too frequently , the service has been slow , and they often try to 	 add on 	 extra services , which sometimes is not needed .
I did n't even buy the bag there !
It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
I hired this company to unlock my car .
Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club 's actual OWNER ?!
I go to see her to have my hair cut .
I have eaten here several times and every time the service is slower than slow .

Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
kudos to Allentown Post Office staff
Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
The staff will not even answer the phone for take out .
I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyone s attention .
Stop by at least once or you 'll go to heck !

They are preparing my older son for kindergarten and looks forward to seeing his teacher and friends every day .
Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .

I 'm compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
A lot .
My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
Over-rated
I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just does n't care / know better .
The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
Avoid !

So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
No joke !

Somehow , since she supposedly does n't know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew 	 exactly which dress 	 I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on .
The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .

Excellent service !
I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ) , they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while u r waiting .
The cabins have always been clean .
The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
First of all , if you call for an appointment they wo n't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .

I wonder if they were going down a hill !
Service - the workers are usually pleasant .
Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons .
sheisters
Dr. Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday .
Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
and there prices are really good !
He stood there and told us how he was n't at fault .
I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
First and Last time we 'll eat there
The front desk staff was very pleasant and efficient .
I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
Now that I live here , this is my favorite place to grab flowers for friends and coworkers !
No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so is n't it reasonable to think they might know what they 're doing ?
We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
I used to LOVE this place .
We order take out from here all the time and we are never disappointed .
I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
This place is clean and well run with great people .
Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
The Worst Chinese I 've Ever Had
This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .

I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
She answers all questions asked and provides the best service i have ever seen .
You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ) .
They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
Billing Issues ...
Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying 	 Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! 	 .
Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
That did it for me .. no more Raina 's .
The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .

Great Wine & Service
I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership .
I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
They have been my only 	 go - to 	 resource since we first did business together .
Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
HCC 's new nine was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course !!
	 Dr. Shady 	 is a jerk .
They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
They do n't take coupons .
I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !

Excellent service and quality
The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
How do these places stay in business .
Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT !

Okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year .
In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I 'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
Would n't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ) .
A great cinema in a great location .
I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
Best meat pies in Canada
I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was n't possible .
Go somewhere else ...
Darla is amazing , I would recoment her to anyone .
This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
She basically said if the children getting off the bus are n't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife 's work and towed it back to fix it .
I have visited Dr. Cooper 's office twice and I am very impressed with how friendly and polite the staff is .
After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
Thank you , Bowtie !
Rude and Untrustworthy

They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
I can not say enough about this place .
these guys were fantastic !
After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !

I would n't go to anyone else .
Amazing customer service
No tub .
There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
Friendly responses .
It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( do n't forget to tell 'em it s really a ' pagen ' thing ! ) .
Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
thank you
Never a bad smokehouse burger though !
I would highly recommend David to anyone .
I 'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe do n't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they do n't want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
Service was excellent !
Good food , good location , and good prices .
And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
I mean , I do n't care if he does n't know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there 's no way I 'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .

The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
I did n't think so but you could be right . 	
I can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
Responsive , kept me apprised of status .
The food was incredibly bland .
The waiting staff is beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ) .
Had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant .
Took a bite , it tasted odd .
The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
Great Place !
This place is awesome
The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .

I would recommend them to anyone ..
I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
I rated it 5 stars .
I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
I had to get a permit here , it was cool
anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
Like the sushi , do n't like the pad thai .

THIS IS THE WORST SCHOOL I VE BEEN TO !!!!!!
Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
Poor Service
I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
They came on time and completed their work quickly .
On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
Dessert was ... hmmm , that 's interesting , I do n't even remember dessert .
Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
Dumbest F'ers ever

Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I 've ever eaten ( and I 've eaten a lot ) .
I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!! !
from start to finish they were top notch .
I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still would n't budge .
Even my PA i went to the other day said 	 it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you 	 .
But this location has the worst weekend staff I 've seen EVER .
Favorite DD spot in the area !
They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
They are like family .
I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
The craziest part is that they are n't even based locally at the city I 'm in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
The window did n't break !
My wife and kids ca n't get enough .
They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .

Relish
seriously , can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat ?
Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that 's going to be anywhere you go !
I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
The salespeople are never available , the lines are always too long , and all the people want is a sale .
Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
Reasonable rate .
Liars , negative stars !
And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient .
It 's an entirely up and down experience , however .
Now , I wo n't eat fast food Chinese unless it 's from this place .
We waited until 2:25 PM and then left .
Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
I have been extremely pleased with the signs and pop - up banners she has supplied to me over the years - a truly first class family business run by Tina and her husband Chris .
Overall , Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot .
My husband has been a professional chef , so he is a good judge of quality food .
Maybe he did n't do a good job and they told him so .
it was worth of the ride more than an hour ...
What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
GREAT Store GREAT Service !

My experience was awful though .
And waited .
I 'm really surprised by the negative reviews .
The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly .
Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
So here we are in Manson .
I 've had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons / barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut !
Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
Additionally , when there was confusion ( my fault ) , they left me flowers along with a personalized gift .
That 's what I call customer service !
Fast Service Called them one hour ago and they just left my house five minutes ago .
My friend and I went there for lunch today .
Will be staying here any and every time I come anywhere near .
Like the girl with the fuse problem ...

Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
Hard to get into though because of road construction .
Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) .
They must have read these reviews and improved !
Great first experience .
Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever .
Good job very professional .
Not impressed !!!
The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman .
It 's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner 's own unprofessionalism .
The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients .
We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
Loved the pool and BBQ .
Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .

Mr. Villega is an exceptional California criminal defense lawyer .

The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
Kyle with Bullwark
I used to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings .
When I inquired he rudely replied 	 in the morning when things are checked out you 'll get it back .
